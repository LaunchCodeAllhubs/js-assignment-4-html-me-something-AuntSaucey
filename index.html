            I really enjoy gardening and growing flowers as a fun, relaxing, satisfying hobbie. Watching my plants grow and thrive is a very satisfying experience for me. Also being told how amazing my garden looks and how good it is doing makes me even happier! I highly recommnend starting a garden of your own!

         <img src="images/images/20230715_153625.jpg" alt="final garden update" width="500" height="auto">
         <p id = "lastImage">
            This is the most recent picture i have of my garden this year. This is where all your hard work and blood and sweat pays off! My zucchini have gotten so big they have overrun the garden, including my poor tomatoes which are struggling to grow this year a little bit. This is why i love and enjoy gardening so much. It is a amazing feeling to see what you can do with just your own two hands some hard work!
