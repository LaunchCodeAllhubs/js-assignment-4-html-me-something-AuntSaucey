            I really enjoy gardening and growing flowers as a fun, relaxing, satisfying hobbie. Watching my plants grow and thrive is a very satisfying experience for me. Also being told how amazing my garden looks and how good it is doing makes me even happier! I highly recommnend starting a garden of your own!

         <p id = "firstImage"> 
             This is the first picture of my garden this year. This picture was taken right after a long tiring day of tilling, measuring where to put the plants and then planting all my vegetables for this year. Do not worry all the hard work pays off!

         <h3>Final garden update!</h3>
         <p id = "lastImage">
            This is the most recent picture i have of my garden this year. This is where all your hard work and blood and sweat pays off! My zucchini have gotten so big they have overrun the garden, including my poor tomatoes which are struggling to grow this year a little bit. This is why i love and enjoy gardening so much. It is a amazing feeling to see what you can do with just your own two hands some hard work!
